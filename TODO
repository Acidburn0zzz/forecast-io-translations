- We should allow leaf nodes of the template tree to be zero-argument
  functions.
- We should allow some way of passing variables or data down the tree.

Doing both of the above would allow us, at least in English, to remove the
hacky prefix-stripping we currently do on days of the week and let us pass a
"use_preposition" flag to them:

    "morning": function() {
      return this.use_preposition ? "in the morning" : "morning";
    }

This would be a lot cleaner.
