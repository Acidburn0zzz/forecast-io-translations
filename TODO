we need to test a few more "X, then Y" cases, where X and Y are any of the
below:

  (starting X Y)
  (until X Y)
  (during X Y)
  (during X (and Y Z))
  (clauses (until X Y) (starting-again (in Z)))
  (clauses (starting X Y) (continuing-until Z))

The following periods still need to get tested:

today-morning
today-afternoon
today-night
later-today-night
tomorrow-afternoon
tomorrow-evening
tomorrow-night
